# Caper
In short, this is version of Hyprpaper that implements a non-interactive widget
overlay ontop of the actual image of the wallpaper. This allows for a person to
view and display whatever information they want to ontop of their wallpapers. 
This functionality is limited but will be expanded to include executable
outputs to stdout and configuration of how the text works.
